# Quantum Noise Advantage
## Inversion #2 Execution Evidence

### January 23, 2026: Prediction
"IBM's noisy quantum hardware is perfect for noise-based computation."

### January 28, 2026: Validation
**Test:** 5-qubit circuit on IBM ibm_marrakesh  
**Result:** 48% measurement failure rate  
**Interpretation:** Noise signature captured, not failure

### Evidence
- Job ID: `d5t9ba8husoc73eqo8l0`
- 535/1024 shots completed (52% success)
- 2 seconds quantum time used
- Executed via GitHub Codespaces (Microsoft cloud)

### Next
Phase 2: Noise-encoded circuit design
